# Linear Actuator Calcalation Note
Stepper motor 1.8 deg/step
Micro Step Driver(uStep) = 1/2 => 1.8/2 deg = 0.9 deg/step  
Lead screw Travel length(distance) = 120 mm   
Lead screw movement => 2 mm/revolution  
From min to max distance = 60 revs  
For 1 rev = 360 deg  
360/0.9 = 400 step/rev  
400 steps/rev x 60 rev = 24,000 step
